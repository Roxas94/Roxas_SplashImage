# SplashImage

### Introduction
An easy to use **plugin** for **RPG Maker MV**, which allows you to splash an image on screen.\
It can be quite useful if you want to show something *(letters, maps, ...)* to the player in addition to the boring text boxes that every game has.\
Just be creative.

### Screenshot
Here is an example of how I used the plugin to show an old log of a scientist to the player.

### How To Install
1. **Download** the plugin *"SplashImage.js"*
2. **Copy** the plugin to *"js\plugins\"* (inside your project folder)
3. Now you can find and **activate it in your RPG Maker MV project**.

### How To Use
To use it, you have to make an event and make a script call.
There are two ways to do this:
- `showSplashImage("nameOfTheImageYouWantToOpen");`
- `showSplashImage("nameOfTheImageYouWantToOpen", opacityValue);`

The first call will show you the image with the **default opacity, configurable in the plugin options**.\
The second call will show you the image with a **specific opacity value**. (opacity can be 0-255)

### Dependencies
None.

### Licence
Free for any game.
The software is provided as is, without any warranties.
But it would be nice if you credit me in your game. ðŸ˜€
