# SplashImage

### Introduction
An easy to use **plugin** for **RPG Maker MV**, which allows you to splash an image on screen.
It can be quite useful if you want to show something (letters, maps, ...) in addition to the boring text boxes that every game has.

Just be creative.

### Screenshot
Here is an example of how I used the plugin to show an old log of a scientist to the player.

### How To Install
- Download the plugin "Roxas_SplashImage.js"
- Copy the file to js\plugins\ (inside your project folder)
- Now you can find and activate it in your RPG Maker MV project.

### How to use
To use it, you have to make an event and make a script call.
There are two ways to do this:
- showSplashImage("nameOfTheImageYouWantToOpen");
- showSplashImage("nameOfTheImageYouWantToOpen", opacityValue);

The first call will show you the image with the default opacity, configured in the plugin options.
The second call will show you the image with a specific opacity value. (opacity can be 0-255)

### Dependencies
None.

### Licence
Free for any game.
But it would be nice if you credit me in your game. ðŸ˜€
