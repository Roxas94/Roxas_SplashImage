# Roxas_SplashImage

###Introduction
A little and easy to use plugin for RPG Maker MV.
It allows you to splash an image on the screen.
It is useful if you want to show a letter, a log, a map or something else to the player.
So it should be possible to tell stories without a single character or to improve your story with some optional/additional information.

###Screenshot
Here is an example of how I used the plugin to show an old log of a scientist to the player.

###How to install
- Download the plugin "Roxas_SplashImage.js"
- Copy the file to js\plugins\ (inside your project folder)
- Now you can find and activate it in your RPG Maker MV project.

###How to use
To use it, you have to make an event and make a script call.
There are two ways to do this:
- showSplashImage("nameOfTheImageYouWantToOpen");
- showSplashImage("nameOfTheImageYouWantToOpen", opacityValue);

The first call will show you the image with the default opacity, configured in the plugin options.
The second call will show you the image with a spacific opacity value. (opacity can be 0-255)

###Dependencies
None.

###Licence
Free for any game.
But it would be nice if you credit me in your game. :D
